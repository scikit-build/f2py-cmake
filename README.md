This provides helpers for using F2Py. Use:

```cmake
include(UseF2Py)
```

You must have found a Python interpreter beforehand. This will define a
`F2Py::F2Py` target (along with a matching `F2PY_EXECUTABLE` variable). It will
also provide the following helper functions:

```cmake
f2py_object_library(<name> <type>)

f2py_generate_module(<module> <files>...
                  [F2PY_ARGS <args> ...]
                  [F77 | F90]
                  [NOLOWER]
                  [OUTPUT_DIR <OutputDir>]
                  [OUTPUT_VARIABLE <OutputVariable>]
                  )
```

## Example

```cmake
find_package(
  Python
  COMPONENTS Interpreter Development.Module NumPy
  REQUIRED)

include(UseF2Py)

# Create the F2Py `numpyobject` library.
f2py_object_library(f2py_object OBJECT)

f2py_generate_module(fibby fib1.f OUTPUT_VARIABLE fibby_files)

python_add_library(fibby MODULE "${fibby_files}" WITH_SOABI)
target_link_library(fibby PRIVATE f2py_object)
```

## scikit-build-core

To use this package with scikit-build-core, you need to include it in your build
requirements:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["scikit-build-core", "numpy", "f2py-cmake"]
build-backend = "scikit_build_core.build"
```

## Vendoring

You can vendor UseF2Py into your package, as well. This avoids requiring a
dependency at build time and protects you against changes in this package, at
the expense of requiring manual re-vendoring to get bugfixes and/or
improvements. This mechanism is also ideal if you want to support direct builds,
outside of scikit-build-core.

You should make a CMake helper directory, such as `cmake`. Add this to your
`CMakeLists.txt` like this:

```cmake
list(APPEND CMAKE_MODULE_PATH "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake")
```

Then, you can vendor our file into that folder:

```bash
pipx run f2py-cmake vendor cmake
```
